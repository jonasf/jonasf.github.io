In late November the development team from Tradera visited the [Build Stuff conference](http://buildstuff.lt/) in Vilnius, Lithuania.

The Build Stuff conference is mainly focused on the .NET-platform so the conference is a good fit for Tradera who has a platform built mainly on .NET. With several good speakers, a competetitive ticket price and being in a city that is among the cheapest in Europe this conference is great for both learning and team building.
